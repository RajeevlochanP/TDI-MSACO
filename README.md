## 🚀 Overview

This project simulates robot path planning using the **Terminal Distance Index-based Multi-Step Ant Colony Optimization** (TDI-MSACO) algorithm. It includes:
- Multi-step ant movement logic
- Dynamic TDI updates
- Collision detection in continuous space
- Basic GUI visualization with HTML Canvas
